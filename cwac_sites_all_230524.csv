A good variety of waterbirds occurs. Large variations in counts of ducks, shorebirds and other species, in summer and winter, reflect variations in water levels due to area's uncertain and erratic rainfall; pans need heavy rain to flood, and most inflow is sheetwash from higher up valley. Formerly, water inflow after dry periods was followed by proliferation of small aquatic crustacea (<i>Daphnia</em>); numbers of ducks and shorebirds (especially Blackwinged Stilt) arrived to breed, the young apparently being dependent on the crustacean food supply (A.J. Tree). In 1995 a large population of fish-eating birds occurred after bream entered the system during the 1994-95 flood and bred prolifically. Great recent increases in Ruff numbers possibly associated with increase in Diptera following increased sewage inflow (A.J. Tree). A recent and severe threat is influx of sewage from nearby Ostrich farm paddocks, through which sheetwash flows; high concentrations of <i>Daphnia</em> no longer occur and breeding birds are much less numerous.",NA,NA,NA,"UNKNOWN","UNKNOWN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2009-07-31,NA,26.57489,-33.63201,31,1994-01-08,2012-02-11,33382634,"26.57082165382777,-33.63228988288547,0 26.57069765748466,-33.63240176434129,0 26.57115388230571,-33.63312730604603,0 26.57256484475646,-33.63506735667534,0 26.57355114738955,-33.63652631846809,0 26.57446466955084,-33.63786051623165,0 26.57503786318712,-33.63866543645026,0 26.57521693793862,-33.63898591844495,0 26.57473560570272,-33.63962132857734,0 26.57463443635666,-33.64021643314918,0 26.57470807940051,-33.6405827439642,0 26.57541589180629,-33.64046414422993,0 26.57556653506973,-33.64060222879083,0 26.576085115584,-33.64071175019115,0 26.57618439781662,-33.6405598640423,0 26.57632402978819,-33.64042865761431,0 26.57647606202534,-33.64027822969025,0 26.57662326114999,-33.64023042548539,0 26.57680547717903,-33.6401875278469,0 26.57697654582512,-33.64011653757638,0 26.5771686096048,-33.64006342534394,0 26.57725692924425,-33.63998610686902,0 26.57739133923535,-33.63977419249473,0 26.57756437054042,-33.63967960059355,0 26.57787447231171,-33.63966040829711,0 26.57815282791452,-33.63962897462977,0 26.57840696753397,-33.63953680197601,0 26.57865414925478,-33.6394354616779,0 26.57872640257584,-33.63925780272523,0 26.5786771761849,-33.63904888595945,0 26.57846545816195,-33.63885534878538,0 26.57828229011122,-33.63878207435379,0 26.57798341037781,-33.63867349677452,0 26.57785913779519,-33.63862376430181,0 26.57767464899779,-33.63843225696711,0 26.57732688903501,-33.63792857431201,0 26.57714883238374,-33.63767934046204,0 26.57698203519763,-33.63731039068948,0 26.57691739353002,-33.63695878839263,0 26.57698626978993,-33.63674076476472,0 26.57722381672201,-33.63629764757382,0 26.57758365527631,-33.6355061797666,0 26.5778127381235,-33.6348426415142,0 26.57800571317329,-33.6343516463604,0 26.57828885780891,-33.63349351890037,0 26.57826319075662,-33.63320400203113,0 26.5783059730547,-33.63271726255463,0 26.57845747570336,-33.63246244262573,0 26.57869265675349,-33.63217995023562,0 26.57923880311468,-33.63185422189747,0 26.57987724834307,-33.63142787486881,0 26.58022371740948,-33.6310720744461,0 26.58052482546595,-33.63063183246695,0 26.58052507614674,-33.63042592516089,0 26.5799112570739,-33.62988824721094,0 26.57839332774471,-33.62884192364337,0 26.57718927531689,-33.62942502802631,0 26.5760033681717,-33.6299460655391,0 26.57530448802901,-33.63003762742682,0 26.57433220762587,-33.63001548655464,0 26.57377572619245,-33.6301288362609,0 26.57323668302962,-33.63042548557392,0 26.57282697384628,-33.63092949206964,0 26.57243998711718,-33.63152201995769,0 26.57131934191614,-33.63195292724428,0 26.57082165382777,-33.63228988288547,0"

Some vegetation on pan floor, mainly grasses; shoreline open, providing good habitat for shorebirds. Infrequently inundated (possibly full only every 10 years). Two summer and two winter counts available, showing reasonable numbers of a relatively good variety of waterfowl and shorebirds. In summer, small to moderate numbers of Palearctic waders recorded, together with a few Avocet, and a good number of Blackwinged Stilt in summer 1997; in winter fewer stilt are recorded, and in 1997 there were reasonable counts of Kittlitz's and Blacksmith Plovers.

Holds a good variety of waterbirds, but small numbers of most waterfowl and shorebirds. A nationally significant count of Great Crested Grebe was recorded in winter 1995. Numbers of grebes, cormorants, herons, African Spoonbill, Whitefaced Duck, and Egyptian and Spurwinged Geese, are higher in winter and the biomass graph reflects the concentration of these large waterbirds in this season. The high total count in winter 1997 reflects the presence of 895 Redknobbed Coot. Blacksmith Plover is fairly common all year, and Black Crake and Purple Gallinule are recorded. Low flying by microlight aircraft is a serious threat; boating, and pollution with anglers' waste, are also problems.",NA,NA,NA,"PARTLY PROTECTED","LOCAL GAME/NATURE RESERVE",NA,"SA025 - MAGALIESBERG

Serious threats include eutrophication and sedimentation, and encroachment of alien vegetation (e.g. <i>Paspalum vaginatum</em>); other threats are pollution by domestic sewage and solid waste, illegal access and disturbance, local development, and inflow of storm water.",NA,NA,NA,"PROTECTED","LOCAL GAME/NATURE RESERVE","Rondevlei Nature Reserve","SA116 - FALSE BAY PARK (PROPOSED)",NA,NA,NA,2009-03-23,"20",18.499,-34.06199,96,1992-01-16,2012-01-31,34041830,"18.49625357946755,-34.06091934067865,0 18.49595982560871,-34.06114224802789,0 18.49567470958198,-34.06120196122631,0 18.49537256183233,-34.06105083044874,0 18.49507288169745,-34.06085307227627,0 18.49468837044739,-34.06065206385325,0 18.49434911232501,-34.06066298488986,0 18.49389466920393,-34.06071642737469,0 18.49358711717085,-34.0606583995346,0 18.49329559157729,-34.06083469850395,0 18.49282766543628,-34.06114478877024,0 18.49234129093388,-34.06126726063042,0 18.49182549558066,-34.06141205109513,0 18.4914332306211,-34.06135098769619,0 18.49103774508279,-34.06135997093306,0 18.49061782362826,-34.06129794728176,0 18.49009835636507,-34.06122621033523,0 18.4900215202744,-34.06136974020153,0 18.49024061644612,-34.06149457567209,0 18.49042784500131,-34.06168836925636,0 18.49033470872647,-34.06184858839438,0 18.49040318409658,-34.06215492196469,0 18.49061677483209,-34.0623963820177,0 18.49074153640645,-34.06272798585606,0 18.4908953085821,-34.06306040882799,0 18.49110167200616,-34.06339522745336,0 18.49136551385725,-34.06373200950349,0 18.49163551942182,-34.06397524157357,0 18.49202166577975,-34.06415258347356,0 18.49246565762604,-34.06423975852408,0 18.49288116672763,-34.06434912234484,0 18.49326362667044,-34.0644618096032,0 18.49361522588772,-34.06444185772426,0 18.49395656519556,-34.06459243035015,0 18.49440937018288,-34.06461029192681,0 18.49465321585385,-34.06467120779131,0 18.4949381538045,-34.06473377450173,0 18.49520250472004,-34.06479550533162,0 18.4954090631893,-34.06478681216451,0 18.49569197148358,-34.06488332808885,0 18.49582384491137,-34.06509341581859,0 18.49602304412352,-34.06520485372248,0 18.49626955319229,-34.06521562620198,0 18.49661903351759,-34.06523047210909,0 18.49676805451534,-34.0651509738975,0 18.49698387920537,-34.06498755686171,0 18.49717596642783,-34.06487473432527,0 18.49737096175296,-34.06471164682039,0 18.49761849875679,-34.06470394447062,0 18.49784137379675,-34.06476346159901,0 18.49811325778693,-34.06468855022646,0 18.49838725337243,-34.06458020890025,0 18.49863871687897,-34.06450510205814,0 18.49905147779373,-34.06448767693075,0 18.4994982961488,-34.06459100146533,0 18.49978162037668,-34.06467043863047,0 18.50003111080672,-34.06462941408678,0 18.50035037361882,-34.06445489978108,0 18.50058931141822,-34.06424284857269,0 18.50088185049101,-34.06416939802501,0 18.50146789935634,-34.06402304366967,0 18.50167729972783,-34.06398080018873,0 18.50187819613808,-34.06407443476923,0 18.5021375889792,-34.06422155122592,0 18.50260420721595,-34.06432524757722,0 18.50282102581127,-34.0644524223687,0 18.50273409593903,-34.06453429597573,0 18.50261925740287,-34.06473425174701,0 18.50252494087329,-34.06493501585553,0 18.50243377737485,-34.06508482283719,0 18.5025515695292,-34.06517458163464,0 18.50277699938489,-34.06518340389152,0 18.50285125433813,-34.06498213862694,0 18.50294472278558,-34.06479848346134,0 18.50305299269182,-34.06462450941424,0 18.5033639837179,-34.06461242160905,0 18.50364814154475,-34.06455216514667,0 18.50393294782342,-34.06449224122108,0 18.5039425822641,-34.06430559354161,0 18.50398397889231,-34.06405000093275,0 18.50386839478986,-34.06379546769984,0 18.50375064424604,-34.06334729872717,0 18.50356239113191,-34.06306703365032,0 18.50347438741611,-34.06284199274051,0 18.50349934116318,-34.06243359262707,0 18.50332572343268,-34.06211030374667,0 18.50335004993167,-34.06164391682441,0 18.50305974106057,-34.06125964969522,0 18.50273209818242,-34.06106077850542,0 18.50263151950863,-34.06084650304525,0 18.50277396378647,-34.06037418508404,0 18.50239771044571,-34.05992684503897,0 18.50200640143069,-34.05986566264856,0 18.50156862643725,-34.05961576181399,0 18.50141598793512,-34.05928401180869,0 18.50134604092516,-34.05912145978106,0 18.50080356527008,-34.05914404442363,0 18.50037486852527,-34.05924562740039,0 18.49991808726274,-34.05934619057622,0 18.49953969250655,-34.05956634957028,0 18.49907567238994,-34.05980676875895,0 18.49853594767964,-34.05988094351288,0 18.49796327972541,-34.06004724845998,0 18.49741624252015,-34.06026084021693,0 18.49681664531647,-34.06040256305789,0 18.49652412862277,-34.0606021582443,0 18.49625357946755,-34.06091934067865,0"

Other important threats include boating, water- skiing, dam construction (Kliphoek River), and gill net fishing; there is some pollution and hunting.","Wetland.","Berg River with floodplain, dry pans",NA,"UNPROTECTED","PRIVATE FARM","Berg River catchment Area","SA104 - LOWER BERG RIVER WETLANDS",NA,NA,NA,2015-03-18,"Veldrif",18.27847,-32.87763,46,1994-08-07,2023-02-12,32521817,"18.265080412597626,-32.88152241531406,0 18.26808490997314,-32.883144204577526,0 18.269672989349374,-32.88431547836625,0 18.271261068725607,-32.886639960498805,0 18.272978105773973,-32.89136081404537,0 18.275553238067687,-32.89530667801486,0 18.281218275146557,-32.89781103930921,0 18.290273412780834,-32.89017286600628,0 18.28965114028938,-32.88736259419105,0 18.290058836059643,-32.88455223324366,0 18.29059527786262,-32.882102182454815,0 18.29216168792732,-32.87965206393326,0 18.294768795089794,-32.87691322965472,0 18.29660342605598,-32.8741743107519,0 18.294060691909863,-32.872012012431895,0 18.290831312255932,-32.87244485166274,0 18.288642206420946,-32.872552982942885,0 18.28645310058596,-32.871219354604115,0 18.2845002407837,-32.86983163895522,0 18.283405687866207,-32.86671370509986,0 18.284027748718245,-32.86258632925422,0 18.283646822128276,-32.85942758546175,0 18.280519313507057,-32.858864316905,0 18.275460614395115,-32.85916622929619,0 18.27246185180661,-32.862063634767615,0 18.268814047546357,-32.861016985232574,0 18.26550956604001,-32.86170065139439,0 18.26398070690152,-32.86363355592859,0 18.26399680015561,-32.86556641833769,0 18.26677556869504,-32.86741347341813,0 18.267151077957124,-32.86962094005966,0 18.26649661895749,-32.87168417549835,0 18.263170679779023,-32.87375606095242,0 18.26274689075467,-32.87695919044282,0 18.263696392745942,-32.879873878569896,0"

Decline evident in number of species and total counts; reason suggested (G. Lamont) for this is recent removal of Parrot-feather manually, and of this and other fringing water plants by herbicide.

Then, as the flowing subsides, the flow reverts to its normal direction. The Nuwejaars River empties into Zoetendalsvlei and when this system is full it overflows into the Heuningnes River, which in turn feeds the Heuningnes Estuary.

It is located approximately 6km south from the small town of Elim, along the R43, directly opposite the Black Oystercatcher Restaurant. Nuwejaars River Wetland is situated runs across two farms, Moddervlei and Hazevlakte, and both are part of the Nuwejaars Wetlands Special Management Area (NWSMA).  Nuwejaars Wetland Special Management Area (NWSMA) operates under a section 21 not for profit company, the Nuwejaars River Nature Reserve (NRNR). The organisation is situated on the Agulhas Plain and covers approximately 45,000 hectares. Membership consists of 25 landowners and include the community of Elim as well as the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. The overriding objective of the organisation is to maintain the high productive agriculture of the area with all its work opportunities and food production, while conserving and managing the natural areas of rivers, wetlands and endangered fynbos as a complete unit, an area of approximately 22,000 hectares. 
The Nuwejaars River Wetland is Palmiet riparian wetland, dominated by palmiet, Prionium serratum, that forms a dense stands to 2 m tall in acid-water streambeds. Perennial acid water streams that have gently flowing water with a gradual incline with deep sandy banks. It plays an important ecological role in binding riverbanks and prevents the scouring of riverbanks. Influenced by catchments management upstream.  Alien vegetation (primarily Acacia saligna and Acacia longifolia) and the subsequent scouring of rivers are a major threat to this unit. The main problem with alien vegetation is that when flooding occurs the alien trees tend to be uprooted and this loosens the sand banks and the process of scouring and erosion of banks occurs. This is a widespread problem in Cape Rivers.
Currently the wetland area is primiraly dominated by dense alien vegetation growth to the east, and the wetland is largely intact and pristine to the west. A rehabilitation project for the wetland area is due to start in 2018.

Shoreline gently sloping; either heavily grazed or with rank grass and weeds. A proposed Ramsar site which holds extremely large numbers of at least 52 waterbird species, concentrated in the 17 bays where rivers enter the dam. Small areas which are regularly counted hold up to 45 000 waterbirds; the entire system may hold 100 000. In drought years the dam provides a refuge for birds from surrounding pans, including Lake Chrissie.
